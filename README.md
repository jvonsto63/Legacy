* There isn't a single problem that can't be solved using duct tape. Not one.
* Asking other people for help is a good skill to have. You don't have to do everything by yourself.
* Student wikis from the past are a fantastic source of ideas and a good place to go if you get stuck.
* Spend some time in the back building stuff. There are some good life lessons awaiting back there.
* Air is a nasty little thing. It likes to escape things any way it can. If you think something is air tight, you're probably wrong.
